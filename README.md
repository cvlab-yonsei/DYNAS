# Pytorch implementation of DYNAS
This is the implementation of the paper "Subnet-Aware Dynamic Supernet Training for Neural Architecture Search".

For detailed information, please checkout the project site [[website](https://cvlab.yonsei.ac.kr/projects/DYNAS/)] or the paper [[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10740)].








## Requirements
This repository has been tested with the following libraries:
```bash
python==3.8.8
numpy==1.19.2
torch==1.8.1
```

## Getting started

```bash
cd exps/NAS-Bench-201-algos

# Example code for SPOS
python train_spos.py \
    --log_dir logs/spos_base \
    --file_name spos_base \
    --method baseline


# Example code for SPOS + Ours
python train_spos.py \
    --log_dir logs/spos_dynamic \
    --file_name spos_dynamic \
    --method dynas
```

- You can run for other baselines (FairNAS and FSNAS) in a similar way.
- Our code is mainly built on [AutoDL](https://github.com/D-X-Y/AutoDL-Projects/tree/main).
